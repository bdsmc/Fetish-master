<h4>Mining finished at blocks 830k for BDSM and 855k for Fetish. There is some TX only stuff going on. However, that is very much a pain. So we will switch over to PoS at a very low rate of interest very soon. Testing models right bnow. The coin count will be lowered to under a million and the coins merged. It is the only sensible route. Everyone will be paid the precise proportion of the coins they hold now but against the new low (rare) coin count)</h4>

<p>Any trouble compiling BDSM just use "make -f makefile.unix" (forget the UPNP).</p>
